<h1>Question One - THE PAYROLL CAT!</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Disaster has struck the C.A.T. Corporation Payroll Division! The lead payroll practitioner, Ms. Whiskers, accidentally misplaced her beloved cat, Catnip, amidst a sea of GUIDs! (I did not know this was possible either). The payroll system, being quirky and overly sentimental, refuses to process payments until Catnip is found.
</p>
<p>
    In order to find the beloved Catnip, you must scour through the GUID sea.   
    <ol>
        <li>Strip each GUID of all its characters apart from c, a or t.</li>
        <li>The first GUID found that spells 'cat' is where your will find Catnip!</li>
        <li>Sum all the digits of the GUID as your final answer, and Catnip will be set free!!</li>
    </ol>
</p>
