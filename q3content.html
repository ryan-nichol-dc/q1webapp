<h1>Question Three - THE PAYROLL LABYRINTH!</h1>
<br>
<p>
    Welcome to DootaPay Inc., the leading global payroll processing company! Everything runs smoothly here... except
    when the DootaBot, our payroll processing robot, gets stuck in the office maze on payday! Your job is to rescue
    DootaBot and ensure the employees get paid on time. The entire office is counting on you â€” developers need their
    coffee funds, consultants their travel reimbursements, and managers their bonuses (of course).
</p>
<br>
<p>
    DootaBot starts at its <span>payroll hub <b>(S)</b></span>, where it generates the magical payroll spreadsheets, and
    it needs to navigate the maze to the bank <span>drop off point <b>(E)</b></span>. Along the way, it must avoid
    <span>obstacales <b>(X)</b></span> like cubicle walls, cluttered desks, and overly chatty employees, whilst also
    making the shortest possible trip. If DootaBot takes too long, chaos will ensue.
</p>
<p>
    DootaBot can move <span>right, left, up or down</span> and <span>one step</span> at a time.
<ol>
    <li>S -> The starting point of the maze
    <li>E -> The end point of the maze
    <li>X -> An obstacle in the maze, you cannot move here
    <li>= -> An open space in the maze, you can move here
</ol>
</p>

    XSXXX
    <br>====X
    <br>X=XXX
    <br>X=EXX
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Calculate the shortest path starting at <span>S</span> and ending at <span>E</span>
    <li>The shortest path in the example is (3,1) => (2, 1) => (1, 1) => (0, 1) => (0,2)
    <li>The <span>final answer</span> is the number of steps it took, <span>4</span> steps
</ol>
